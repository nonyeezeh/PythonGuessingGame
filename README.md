## pyGame - A Mini Guessing Game

Learn the Basics of Python Programming

## Intoduction
The Mini Guessing Game is a simple yet engaging Python program that offers a great opportunity for beginners to learn the basics of programming. In this tiny game, users are given 5 chances to guess the correct number between 1 and 10. While the game itself is straightforward, the code behind it serves as an excellent learning resource for those new to Python and programming in general.

## Learning Python Concepts
By exploring the code for the Mini Guessing Game, beginners can familiarize themselves with fundamental Python concepts, such as:

• Variables and Data Types: Learn how variables are used to store and manage data, such as the target number and the user's guesses.

• Input and Output: Understand how to take user input (guesses) and provide output (clues) based on the game's logic.

• Conditional Statements: Discover how to use conditional statements (if, elif, else) to control the flow of the program and provide feedback to the user based on their guesses.

• Loops: Explore the usage of loops (for or while) to implement the limited number of chances for the user to guess the correct number.

• Random Number Generation: Learn how to generate random numbers, which is essential for setting up the target number in the game.

## Game Instructions
1. Check your Python version by typing python --version in terminal/cmd prompt. If version is python 3.x you can continue. If version is python 2.x, try: python3 --version. If you receive a version replace 'python' with 'python3' for the rest of these instructions below.

2. Start the game: type python(3) pyGuess.py

3. The game will run in the terminal. Answer the first question - your name. Select (X) Start the game (Q) Exit.

4. The player is prompted to guess a number between 1 and 10.
   
5. The player will be informed if their input is out of bounds
   
6. The player is given 5 guesses for every number, once out of guesses the player has lost

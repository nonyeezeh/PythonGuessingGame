PyGuess - The Mini Guessing Game

Learn the Basics of Python Programming

Introduction
The PyGuess Mini Guessing Game is a simple yet engaging Python program that offers a great opportunity for beginners to learn the basics of programming. In this tiny game, users are given 5 chances to guess the correct number between 1 and 10. While the game itself is straightforward, the code behind it serves as an excellent learning resource for those new to Python and programming in general.

Learning Python Concepts
By exploring the code for the game, beginners can familiarize themselves with fundamental Python concepts, such as:

• Variables and Data Types: Learn how variables are used to store and manage data, such as the target number and the user's guesses.

• Input and Output: Understand how to take user input (guesses) and provide output (guidance) based on the game's logic.

• Conditional Statements: Discover how to use conditional statements (if, elif, else) to control the flow of the program and provide feedback to the user based on their guesses.

• Loops: Explore the usage of loops (while) to implement the limited number of chances for the user to guess the correct number.

• Random Number Generation: Learn how to generate random numbers, which is essential for setting up the target number in the game.
